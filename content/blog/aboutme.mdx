I am Micha Johannes Birklbauer, or just Micha, and was born on the 10<sup>th</sup> of August 1995 in the beautiful city of Linz in Austria.
Growing up in the suburbs my childhood was rather unspectacular, a lot of reading, drawing and spending time outside. At the age of 19 I graduated
from highschool with distinction. After community service I enrolled and finished my Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics, a cross border study
program at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz and the University of South Bohemia in Budweis that teaches the interdisciplinary field of
informatics and biology. I wrote my bachelor thesis on "Imputation Of Missing Values In Clinical Data" and got my degree in 2019. I continued
my studies as a master student of "Data Science and Engineering" at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria in Hagenberg. I specialized
in "Marketing and Production" and "Data-driven Drug Design" and wrote my thesis about "Automatic identification of important interactions and
interaction-frequency-based scoring in protein-ligand complexes" in cooperation with the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg. I finished my
master's in 2021 and since then I am doing my PhD in Computer Science and work as a researcher in computational proteomics at the Bioinformatics
Research Group of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria in Hagenberg. In my free time I like to go to the movies, work on hobby projects,
read or paint.
