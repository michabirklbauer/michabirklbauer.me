MS Annika is a crosslink search engine based on [MS Amanda](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr500202e),
aimed at identifying crosslinks of cleavable and non-cleavable crosslinkers from MS2 and MS3 spectra.  

MS Annika is my main PhD project, the biggest features that I developed were:
- Crosslink identification from MS2-MS3-acquisition, which can be read about -> [here](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325)
- Crosslink identification from non-cleavable reagents, which can be read about -> [here (wip)]()
