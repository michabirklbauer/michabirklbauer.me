Instagram JSON Viewer is a python script that transforms Instagram's data - that you get via the Data Download Tool - to a readable format!  

This script was built back in a time when the data download tool only returned an unstructured `json` file. The goal was to process and re-format the file into readable `html` format.  

Today the project is archived and no longer maintained, as you can directly download your data in `html` format now.
