PIA - short for Protein Interaction Analyzer - is a tool for automatic identification of important interactions and interaction-frequency-based scoring
in protein-ligand complexes. PIA was developed as part of my master's thesis "Automatic identification of important interactions and interaction-frequency-based
scoring in protein-ligand complexes" in cooperation with the Institute of Pharmacy of the Paracelsus Medical Private University Salzburg.

This project is actually split up into three repositories:
- [Protein_Docking](https://github.com/michabirklbauer/protein_docking): data and implementations for my master's thesis
- [PIA](https://github.com/michabirklbauer/PIA): a standalone script/library incorporating everything developed for my master's thesis
- [PIAWeb](https://github.com/michabirklbauer/PIAWeb): a web front-end for PIA
