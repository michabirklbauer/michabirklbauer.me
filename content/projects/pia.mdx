PIA - short for Protein Interaction Analyzer - is a tool for automatic identification of important interactions and interaction-frequency-based scoring
in protein-ligand complexes. PIA was developed as part of the master's thesis "Automatic identification of important interactions and interaction-frequency-based
scoring in protein-ligand complexes" in cooperation with the Institute of Pharmacy of the Paracelsus Medical Private University Salzburg.
